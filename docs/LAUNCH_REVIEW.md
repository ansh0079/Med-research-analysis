# 🚀 Medical Research Intelligence Platform - Launch Review

## ⛔ DEPLOYMENT HALTED — NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

**Date:** April 27, 2026  
**Version:** 3.0.0  
**Status:** 🔴 **DEPLOYMENT HALTED — CRITICAL ISSUES PENDING**

---

## ⚠️ Executive Summary

The 3.0.0 release is **NOT ready for production deployment**. Claims in previous versions of this document were inaccurate. Multiple P0-critical runtime defects and security vulnerabilities remain unaddressed. The engineering team is actively resolving these issues.

**Do not deploy until all P0 and P1 issues from `ROADMAP.md` and all "Critical" and "High" items from `SECURITY_SUMMARY.md` are verified as resolved.**

## 📊 True Launch Readiness Score

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Security** | 40/100 | 🔴 Critical gaps: missing Helmet (being added), weak JWT default, CORS risks, incomplete auth |
| **Testing** | 55/100 | 🟡 Unit tests pass but mock DB; no integration tests against real SQLite |
| **Performance** | 70/100 | 🟡 Caching in place; vector search untested under load |
| **Documentation** | 60/100 | 🟡 Inconsistent across LAUNCH_REVIEW, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, SECURITY_SUMMARY |
| **Monitoring** | 50/100 | 🟡 Sentry scaffolded; structured logging not yet implemented |
| **Overall** | **55/100** | 🔴 **NOT LAUNCH READY** |

## 🚨 Blockers (P0 — Must Fix Before Deploy)

### Database Reliability
- [x] Missing `Database` methods implemented (`logSearch`, `saveArticle`, `unsaveArticle`, `getSavedArticles`, `createSession`, `updateSessionActivity`, `cleanExpiredCache`)
- [x] `search_alerts` schema aligned with route (added `sources` column)
- [x] `database/production_schema.sql` repaired (corrupted header fixed, full schema regenerated)
- [ ] Integration tests against real SQLite database (in progress)

### Security Hardening
- [x] **Helmet/CSP** — Security headers added to `server-enhanced.js`
- [x] **JWT Secret** — Production startup now fails fast if `JWT_SECRET` is missing or set to the default placeholder
- [x] **CORS** — Production startup now fails fast if `CORS_ORIGINS` is unset
- [x] **Input Validation** — Joi schemas added for all major endpoints (`/api/ai/*`, `/api/user/save`, `/api/alerts`, `/api/quiz/generate`, `/api/ai/synthesize`)
- [x] **Authentication** — `/api/ai/*` routes now gated behind `requireAuthJwt`
- [ ] **Authorization** — Role-based access control not yet implemented
- [ ] **CSRF Protection** — Not yet implemented
- [ ] **XSS Output Encoding** — Partial (CSP + input sanitization); output encoding pending

### Privacy
- [x] **LogRocket PII Sanitization** — `identifyLogRocketUser` now masks `name` and `email`; only non-identifiable `id`, `plan`, and `role` are transmitted

## 📋 Remaining P1 Issues (Fix Before Public Beta)

1. **Missing migrations directory** — ✅ Created `database/migrations/` with baseline migration
2. **UI auth coverage** — `fetchWithSession` not yet used for all API calls
3. **Saved articles backend wiring** — Modern UI still uses `localStorage` as source of truth
4. **Realtime presence events** — Socket handler does not emit `presence:update`
5. **Vector search UI toggle** — `api.vectorSearch` implemented but not exposed in UI
6. **Graceful shutdown** — Basic `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` handler exists; needs Socket.IO drain
7. **Structured logging** — `pino` installed but not wired into request pipeline
8. **Schema consolidation** — SQLite and Postgres schemas now both valid, but could be further consolidated

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Unit Tests
```
Tests:       67 passed (mocked DB)
Coverage:    Happy paths only; no auth or DB-layer coverage
```

### Integration Tests
```
Status:      In progress
target:      Real SQLite file for history/save/unsave/annotations/alerts
```

### E2E Tests
```
Status:      Playwright configured but not actively maintained
```

## 🔐 Security Checklist (Updated)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| API keys in .env | ✅ | No hardcoded keys in source |
| Rate limiting | ✅ | Custom cache-based limiter active |
| CORS configured | 🟡 | Fails fast in prod; dev origins permissive |
| Helmet headers | ✅ | CSP, HSTS, referrer policy active |
| Input validation | ✅ | Joi on all major POST/PUT bodies |
| SQL injection prevention | ✅ | Parameterized queries via Kysely + better-sqlite3 |
| XSS protection | 🟡 | CSP + input sanitization; output encoding pending |
| CSRF protection | ❌ | Not implemented |
| npm audit | 🟡 | 11 vulnerabilities (5 moderate, 6 high) — run `npm audit fix` |

## 📝 Updated Launch Day Checklist

### Before Launch (All Must Be ✅)
- [ ] All P0 issues resolved and verified
- [ ] All P1 issues resolved or explicitly deferred
- [ ] Integration tests pass against real SQLite
- [ ] `npm audit` shows 0 high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security scan (Snyk or equivalent) clean
- [ ] Load test passed for expected peak traffic
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested

### Launch Sequence (Do Not Execute Until Cleared)
1. Final code review and merge
2. Deploy to staging
3. Run integration + smoke tests
4. Deploy to production
5. Monitor health checks and error rates for 24h
